GNN Implementation contains the code of the graph neural network implementation.

MLP Implementation contains the code of the MLP implementation. We initially wanted to compare the accuracy between the GNN 
implementation and a standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) implementation. Ideally, we wanted to show that GNNs perform better 
than standard MLPs on graph-stuctured data; however, we were not able to fully build the MLP implementation (using the PyTorch 
framework)
